<h1>Atlanta Child Murders Geographic Profile</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The Wayne Williams case, also known as the "Atlanta Child Murders," involved a tragic sequence of events in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1979 to 1981, during which 29 murders were recorded. Although Williams was implicated in these crimes, he was never formally convicted for the murders. In college, while a member of the Criminal Justice Society, I developed a geographic profile of the murders. This profile, along with case research created by fellow society members, was featured at a symposium. Our collective efforts were recognized with an invitation to CrimeCon in Orlando, Florida, highlighting our contributions to the understanding of the case.<br />


<h2>Sofware Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Excel</b> 
- <b>Google Earth</b>

<h2>Process</h2>

I utilized Microsoft Excel as my primary tool to construct a geographical profile. The methodology encompassed a meticulous process of gathering data on abduction and body recovery locations, which was then systematically entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Leveraging the power of Excel's formulas, I executed distance calculations, conducted spatial analyses, and derived pertinent statistical measures. By creating scatter plots and charts within Excel, I visualized the geographical distribution of the events, aiming to identify discernible patterns or clusters. The application of mathematical models facilitated the identification of potential hotspots, offering insights into offender behavior and movement patterns. While Excel was effective for initial data organization and basic analysis, I do also recognize that specialized Geographic Information System (GIS) software could have provided more advanced capabilities for a comprehensive analysis. As a college student without access to such software, I had to develop and employ my own methodologies to derive meaningful insights from the available data.

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.
